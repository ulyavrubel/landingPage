          <h3>Our Teachers</h3>
          <p>
            With a drive to continue educating students, our teachers are the
            mainstay of our school. Their constant support and attention to
            detail ensure you child has the skills to progress in their
            educational career and the tools necessary to excel in the future no
            matter what path they choose. Our teachers encompass a close-knit
            group of highly-skilled, trained, and professional educators that
            are committed to making sure your child propels forward, learns
            more, and achieves their goals on a daily basis in an environment
            that is designed to enrich their lives. We do our part to seek out
            the best of the best when it comes finding the right teacher for
            your student to ensure quality education with a simple focus on
            discipline, respect, and above all learning.

          <p>
            We offer as comprehensive a schedule of Orange County Chinese
            classes as possible. The levels of classes scheduled reflect our
            current students’ needs and the anticipated requirements of new
            students. We may also offer a semi-private Chinese class or private
            Chinese lessons for any level of Chinese. All regularly scheduled
            classes meet once a week for 80 minutes during an eight-week term.
            Below are the currently scheduled Chinese language classes.
